# Life Simulator

A complex biological and social simulation running in the browser. Developed 99% by Google Antigravity* and Gemini 3 Pro (mainly only config and prompting from me). A play enviroment for me to experiment with complete hands off coding/project development. 

*Google Antigravity does support other models I chose to only use Gemini 3 Pro
